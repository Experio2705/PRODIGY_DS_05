Task-05 – Traffic Accident Analysis
Objective
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and determine key contributing factors.

Dataset
US Accidents (2016–2023) – Kaggle

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Optional: Power BI / Tableau for interactive dashboards

Process
Imported and cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, formatted columns).

Engineered time-based and weather-based features for analysis.

Created visualizations for:

Accidents by hour and day of week

Impact of weather and road conditions

Severity distribution across factors

Plotted accident hotspots using location data.

Key Insights
Peak accident times are during morning and evening rush hours.

Rain, snow, and fog significantly contribute to higher accident rates.

Low visibility and poor road conditions correlate with higher severity.

Certain states and cities emerge as accident hotspots.
